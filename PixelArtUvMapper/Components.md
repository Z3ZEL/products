# **Component** , [PAUM_ComponentEvent](Classes.md#componentevent)
> Abstract class common to all components. You can derive from this class to create your own component. All its properties can be accessed in the other components. All methods can be overrided to create your own component.

## *Methods*

### **Apply**
> Apply to the sprite renderer the current texture to map in according to the map and layers cames from the [PAUM_ComponentEvent](Classes.md#componentevent) 

```csharp
public abstract void Apply();
```

### **OnValueChanged**
> Called when a value is changed in the inspector, by default it calls the `Apply` method

```csharp
public void OnValueChange(PAUM_ComponentValue value)
```

# **Animator Overlay** &rarr; [Component](#component)
> The Animator Overlay component is used to overlay a texture on top of the animated texture. This is useful for adding things like blood, dirt, or other effects to the animated texture.
# **Sprite** &rarr; [Component](#component)
> The Sprite component is a basic mapper, it will map the sprite in the SpriteRenderer component in according to the map texture and the skin texture.
# **Compute Sprite** &rarr; [Component](#component)
> The compute sprite component do the same as sprite component but way much faster and lighter because it's calculated on the GPU but for now multi-layering is not supported by this component.
